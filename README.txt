# Project Sync System

A simple bash script to keep all your coding projects synchronized between multiple computers and GitHub.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Daily sync (recommended)
./sync-projects.sh --quick

# Full interactive sync
./sync-projects.sh

# Check status of all repositories
./sync-projects.sh --status

# Bootstrap analysis for new machine setup
./sync-projects.sh --bootstrap
```

## ðŸš€ New Machine Bootstrap

**One-liner to get started on a new machine:**
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citi94/sync/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

**Or manual setup:**
```bash
# 1. Create Projects directory
mkdir -p ~/Projects && cd ~/Projects

# 2. Clone sync system
git clone https://github.com/citi94/sync.git

# 3. Run bootstrap analysis
./sync-projects.sh --bootstrap
```

## What It Does

- **Pulls** the latest changes from GitHub for all your projects
- **Pushes** any local commits you've made
- **Safely stashes** uncommitted changes before syncing
- **Restores** your uncommitted changes after syncing
- **Creates** GitHub repositories for new projects
- **Syncs itself** - the sync system is backed up to GitHub too!

## Safety Features

âœ… **Won't lose your work** - automatically stashes uncommitted changes  
âœ… **Won't break on errors** - continues with other projects if one fails  
âœ… **Logs everything** - see what happened in `sync.log`  
âœ… **Interactive prompts** - asks before creating new repositories  

## Requirements

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated
- Git repositories with `origin` remotes pointing to GitHub

## File Structure

```
Projects/
â”œâ”€â”€ sync/                    # The sync system itself
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sync-projects.sh     # Main script
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sync.log            # Operation log
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md           # Detailed documentation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.txt           # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ sync-projects.sh        # Wrapper script for easy access
â”œâ”€â”€ your-project-1/         # Your actual projects
â”œâ”€â”€ your-project-2/
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## How It Works

1. **Stash** any uncommitted changes in each project
2. **Fetch** and **pull** latest changes from GitHub
3. **Restore** your stashed changes
4. **Push** any local commits to GitHub
5. **Continue** to next project (even if one fails)

## Common Commands

```bash
# Quick daily sync
./sync-projects.sh --quick

# Full sync with prompts for new repos
./sync-projects.sh

# See what needs syncing
./sync-projects.sh --status

# Bootstrap analysis for new machine
./sync-projects.sh --bootstrap

# Get help
./sync-projects.sh --help
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication issues**: Run `gh auth login`
- **Merge conflicts**: Resolve manually, then run sync again
- **Missing remote**: The script will skip repositories without GitHub remotes
- **Check logs**: Look at `sync/sync.log` for detailed information

## ðŸ”„ Bootstrap Process

The bootstrap feature makes setting up a new machine effortless:

**Analysis Phase:**
- Scans your existing projects vs GitHub repositories
- Shows a clear table of what would happen during sync
- Identifies conflicts and provides recommendations

**Batch Operations:**
- Accept all proposed actions at once
- Selective mode for individual choices
- Clone-only mode for safe repository downloads
- Smart backup of existing directories

**Perfect for:**
- Setting up development environment on new machines
- Merging projects from different computers
- Team members joining existing projects
- Recovering from system migrations

Perfect for developers who work on multiple machines and want to keep everything in sync! ðŸš€
